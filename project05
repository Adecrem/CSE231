    #  Computer Project #5

    #import statements

    #  Algorithm

    #    created open_file function
    
    #       asks user for what file they would like to open

    #       if user enters unknown file, prompts user for second

    #    created get_gender function
    
    #       split makes each word into its own value

    #       checks if male or female and outputs based on that

    #   created is_mike function

    #       split makes each word into its own value
    
    #       if Michael or Mike it takes it into account

    #   created is_party function
    
    #       split makes each word into its own value
    
    #       if D or R is stated it takes it into account
    
    #   created print_result function
    
    #       format of where to put data
    
    #   plot_data function given
    
    #   created main function
    
    #       adds if the input per person fits
    
    #       prints results to print_result function
    
    #       asks user if they would like to plot
    
    #       if yes then it will go to plot function
